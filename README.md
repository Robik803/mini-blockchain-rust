# Mini Blockchain (Rust)

Learning blockchain structure through building a small simulator with Rust.

## Overview
A hands-on Rust project to understand blockchain fundamentals by developing a small, modular simulator.  
Focus areas: ownership, traits, error handling, serialization, and CLI design.

## Structure
- `accounts.rs` → account models and balances  
- `instructions.rs` → core operations (`transfer`, `mint`, `burn`)  
- `errors.rs` → custom error definitions  
- `main.rs` → program entrypoint  

## Goal
To master Rust through practical development before moving to on-chain programs with Anchor on Solana.
